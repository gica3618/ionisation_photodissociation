# ionisation_photodissociation
Summary: calculate ionisation and photodissociation in circumstellar gases, taking into account stellar and interstellar radiation

The code is able to read ATLAS stellar atmosphere models given stellar parameters. For the interstellar radiation, the model by Draine is used. Then, the code allows to calculate the photodissociation rate as well as the ionisation balance at a given distance from the star.
